The difference between myhough and Matlab hough was the rho,  in Matlab the rho is from ï»¿ -361 to 361, but we set it from -image diagonal to image diagonal based on the convention on the slides. Which is in this case it is from -256 to 256 . This difference make our plot seems a bit distorted, because of the difference in the scales. There is no difference between thetas  in myhough and matlab hough function.  Due to the difference between the rhos, we can not compare the votes.
